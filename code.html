      <p> These two peices were written in Processing and converted into P5.js in order to be displayed on my website and be more accessable. Both of the animals that I "drew" are ones that I usually gravitate to when I doodle, a giraffe and a rat. My giraffe is intended to be an interactive "drawing" that is fun to play with. I ended up coding the giraffe to grow upside down since it was the first solution I got to when I was figuring out how to make the neck grow with the cursor. I ended up going with it because I found it to be more comedic than just a normal giraffe. Honestly, coding is one of my favorite activites and getting to combine my love for art with it makes it one of the most enjoyable projects I've been able to do.
