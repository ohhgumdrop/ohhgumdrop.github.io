        <p>Some parts of this project look odd. The idea was to use the crowd and traffic to represent a busy life that is sandwiched around social media. The rest of my motivation came from me wanting to learn how to use Premier Pro. I made the video silent because I do not want my audience to be distracted by audio stimulation, as some parts of the video are crowded or have a lot going on. This video is intended to be veiwed on a projector or an electronic screen.
