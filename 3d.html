          <p>I was looking for models and found these three that I found interesting. With these models, I wanted to create a scene that was dream-like and not of this world. I then took the models I had found and decided to build a scene about a magicain going camping at some mysical place to observe a rabit-like creature.

          <p> This is a scan I did for my Art 74 class using the phone app Qlone. The original object was a USB drive. I took exactly what I had gotten from the 3d scan and imported it into Sketchfab and added some different textures and effects.
