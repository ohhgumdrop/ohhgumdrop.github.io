            <p> My influence for this was some of my own recent interest in space and the idea of moon colonies. I also believe that space exploration should not be forgotten, as it has the potential to be a new environment to develop new technologies that can be used on Earth. This project is trying to emulate space! Some of the components in this piece, like the Earth or the space background, are exagerated. The motivation/idea behind the project was space exploration, specifically deeper into space. The intended context is a print of the collage within a gallery that the class is hosting at the school and it also has an augmented reality portion to experience via smartphone. It is best if the project is veiwed with the GIF overlay.
